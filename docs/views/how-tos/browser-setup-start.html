        Set up the kit in your browser
      </h1>

      <p>If you can't install the kit or prefer not to use the kit locally on your computer, you can set up the kit in your browser instead.</p>

      <p>To set up the prototype kit in your browser you will need to use Gitpod. Gitpod creates automated workspaces and dev environments in your browser from a repository on Github.</p>

      <p>This guide will show you how to get setup in 6 steps.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs">read more about using Gitpod on their website</a>.</p>

      <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <p>You will need a Github account to use Gitpod. You can <a href="https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home"> sign up to Github on their website</p>

        <p>If you have any problems, ask a developer on your team, <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net?subject=NHS.UK prototype kit - Installation">email us</a> or get in touch on the <a href="https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com/messages/CFYL2GDGW" rel="nofollow">NHS digital service manual #prototype-kit Slack channel</a>.</p>
